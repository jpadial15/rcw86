Installation guide X-ray data reduction software. We will be installing the full HEASOFT, Chandra, and XMM Newton software. 

###############################################################################################
1) Chandra:

Full description of installation procedure, enviroment variables, and alias can be found here:

http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/download/

First, download the install script "ciao-install":

> wget http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/ciao-install.html

DO NOT INSTALL AS ROOT OR SUPERUSER. Install in a new terminal where no other x-ray packages are initiated.

> bash /<path>/<to>/<script>/ciao-install

Set up an alias:

cshell:
alias ciao "source /soft/ciao-4.11/bin/ciao.csh"

bash:
alias ciao "source /soft/ciao-4.11/bin/ciao.csh"


Common watchout items for installation an initialization can be found here:

http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/watchout.html#install

2) HEASOFT:

We will be installing the full HEASOFT package through source code.This part consists of installing the source code, downloading calibration files, and setting up enviromental variables/ alias's.

Download HEASOFT6.26:

wget http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/lheasoft/release/heasoft-*src.tar.gz

gunzip -c heasoft6.26(src|arch).tar.gz | tar xf -

cd heasoft-6.26/BUILD_DIR/

# make sure configure script will choose correct compilers. 
# On Linux, Cygwin and Darwin, configure will by default choose the first
#   GNU and Perl compilers (gcc, g++, gfortran/g95, perl) it finds in your
#   path (i.e.  the PATH environment variable; see also the "which" command).

    $ setenv CC /usr/bin/gcc              $ export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
    $ setenv CXX /usr/bin/g++             $ export CXX=/usr/bin/g++
    $ setenv FC /usr/bin/gfortran         $ export FC=/usr/bin/gfortran
    $ setenv PERL /usr/bin/perl           $ export PERL=/usr/bin/perl
    $ setenv PYTHON /usr/bin/python       $ export PYTHON=/usr/bin/python


# run the main configure script

./configure >& config.out &     (C Shell variants)
./configure > config.out 2>&1 & (Bourne Shell variants)


### NOTES ON CONFIGURE:

--prefix=dir   (SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTION ONLY)

     Denotes where the libraries, executables, help files, etc.,
     are to be installed.  NOTE that this is slightly different
     than the sense in which "prefix" is used in GNU software,
     in that an additional system-dependent subdirectory will
     first be appended to the prefix argument, below which the
     bin/, lib/, and other directories will be created.
     If no prefix argument is supplied to configure, the default
     is the main heasoft-6.26/ directory itself.

     * In the HEADAS build environment, there are multiple layers of
     installed directories, so if you prefer to delete the source code
     after installing HEASOFT, it is recommended that you provide a
     prefix to configure which installs the software outside of the
     source code tree.

     * Darwin and Cygwin:  If you perform the software installation
     on a disk which has a space or spaces in its name, i.e.
     "/Volumes/Apps And Docs/" or "/cygdrive/My Documents/", the
     initialization step (referred to in step 8 below) will fail because
     it reads that as two separate paths.  Paths with underscores are okay.

   You may notice some WARNING messages in the screen output from configure,
   and may safely ignore those from the third-party packages wcslib and itk:

     wcslib:
     configure: WARNING: Compilation of Fortran wrappers and PGSBOX disabled
     configure: WARNING: Compilation of WCS utilities disabled
     configure: WARNING: CFITSIO disabled
     configure: WARNING: PGPLOT disabled

     itk:
     configure: WARNING: Found Makefile - using build library specs for itcl

### DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL CALIBRATION FILES

Installing all or part of the CALDB is a matter of setting up the CALDB environment variables and downloading and untarring the calibration data.

setenv CALDB /local/home/user/caldb

export CALDB=/local/home/user/caldb


#Downloading and installing CALDB files:

cd $CALDB
wget https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/caldb/software/tools/caldb_setup_files.tar.Z
tar -zxvf caldb_setup_files.tar.Z

# this creates two $CALDB configuration files and an initialization file:

# configuration files created:

# $CALDB/software/tools/alias_config.fits
# $CALDB/software/tools/caldb.config

# initialization files created:

# $CALDB/software/tools/caldbinit.csh (for unix C-shell users) 

# $CALDB/software/tools/caldbinit.sh  (for Bash shell users)

# open the caldbinit.csh or caldbinit.sh in a text editor and edit the firt line so that the $CALDB enviroments variables points to the CALDB directory. 

# setenv CALDB /local/home/user/caldb

# export CALDB=/local/home/user/caldb

# include the initialization file in the .login file for each user.

# source $CALDB/software/tools/caldbinit.csh

# source $CALDB/software/tools/caldbinit.sh

# Download the calibration files

cd $CALDB

### START THE BUILD PROCESS:


make >& build.log &     (C Shell variants)
make > build.log 2>&1 & (Bourne Shell variants)


#you can see the build.log with

tail -f build.log

#exit with ctrl-c

VERY IMPORTANT: Check your build.log for errors before proceeding!
   If a problem occurs and is discovered at this point, it may be easy
   to correct (contact the appropriate help address listed above). By
   contrast, if an error occurs, but you continue with the next step,
   it may make resolving the problem more complex or more time-consuming.

   The easiest way to check your build.log for errors is to look
   for occurrences of the string ***. (Most UNIX utilities which
   use regular expression matching require these to be "escaped"
   using backslashes, e.g. \*\*\*).  You may safely ignore references
   in the build log to "char ***" or '...__PRETTY_FUNCTION__," ***...'


make install >& install.log &     (C Shell variants)
make install > install.log 2>&1 & (Bourne Shell variants)


Check install log for errors as described above.


## Set up enviroment to use:

For users of C Shell variants (csh, tcsh):

      setenv HEADAS /path/to/your/installed/heasoft-6.26/(PLATFORM)
      source $HEADAS/headas-init.csh

For users of Bourne Shell (sh, ash, ksh, and bash):

      export HEADAS=/path/to/your/installed/heasoft-6.26/(PLATFORM)
      . $HEADAS/headas-init.sh


In the examples above, (PLATFORM) is a placeholder for the platform-
   specific string denoting your machine's architecture, for example:

      x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-libc2.29
      x86_64-apple-darwin18.5.0

### set up alias "heainit":

For users of C Shell variants (csh, tcsh):

      setenv HEADAS /path/to/your/installed/heasoft-6.26/(PLATFORM)
      alias heainit "source $HEADAS/headas-init.csh"

For users of Bourne Shell (sh, ash, ksh, and bash):

      HEADAS=/path/to/your/installed/heasoft-6.26/(PLATFORM)
      export HEADAS
      alias heainit=". $HEADAS/headas-init.sh"
